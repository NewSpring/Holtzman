## Prerequisites

- [Meteor](curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh): `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`;
- [Node 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Quick Start

```
git clone git@github.com:NewSpring/Holtzmann.git
cd Holtzmann
npm link
apollos setup
apollos run
```

## Structure

This repo contains the code base used to build v5 of the NewSpring site and native app. Our sites and native apps share much of the same functionality, and therefore share the same code.

- `/assets`: additional assets that don't need to be loaded over a web server
- `/client`: entry point for client
- `/imports`: basically all code, client and server
- `/public`: static assets to be loaded from web server
- `/scripts`: command line scripts used for deployment, testing, etc
- `/server`: entry point for server
- `/stylesheets`: sass for generating our css using sass and junction
- `*/__tests__`: tests adjacent to the module they are testing
- `*/__stories__`: react storybook stories adjacent to the module they are displaying
- `*/__mocks__`: module mocks for testing adjacent to the module they mock.
- `main.html`: root HTML file
- `mobile-config.js`: used to generate cordova apps
- `package.json`: used to manage yarn dependencies and etc.
- `yarn.lock`: used to make sure all developers are using the same package versions

## Local Development

### Basics

To install all dependencies, we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). To get started:
1. Clone down the repo
2. Make sure you have the Yarn CLI [installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. Run `yarn`.
4. run `npm link`. This will bind `apollos` to your system to be used to run this app ([more info](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)).

`apollos setup`: This command will bootstrap the application. This may take some time.

  - `-c || --clean`: Force rebuild of application
  - `-l || --log <level>`: NOT IMPLEMENTED

`apollos run`: This will start a local server to serve the site and print its address in your console.

  - `-p || --port`: NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - `-v || --verbosity`: NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - `-q || --quick`: Removes built files (`.meteor/local`)
  - `-n || --native`: This will run the native version of the application but allow you to work on most of the code in your web browser
  - `--ios`: Run the native app in the iOS simulator
  - `--android`: Run the native app in the Android simulator
  - `--device`: Run the native app on a device. Use in conjunction with `--ios` or `--android`
  - `--production`: Run the application in production mode
  - `--debug`: Run the application in debug mode

### Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit tests. These tests are located in `__tests__` subfolders adjacent to the thing they're testing.

To run tests, call `yarn test` or `yarn test -- --watch`. This will also run `eslint` and `flow` tests when complete.

### Linting

This project includes linting using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).  To enable linting in Visual Studio Code, you will need to install the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

To install the extension you'll need to press `âŒ˜+P`, paste the following command and press enter.

```
ext install vscode-eslint
```

To manually run eslint, use `yarn lint`.

### Typing

This project contains static typing for most code. We use [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) for this. To enable flow to a file,
add `// @flow` to the very top of the file.

To run flow, use `yarn flow`.

## Deploys

This project can be automatically deployed by Travis CI using release tags. We have 2 different versions of the application, web and native. We also have 3 different environments to deploy to: alpha, beta, production.

To deploy, create a release/tag using a combination of the site name, site version, environment target, and version number.

```
newspring/web/production/1.0.8
newspring/native/beta/0.0.3-45
```
