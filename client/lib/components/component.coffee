class Namespace
  constructor: (@namespace, @templateInstance) ->



###

  We extend the original dot operator to support {{> Foo.Bar}}. This
  goes through a getTemplateHelper path, but we want to redirect it to
  the getTemplate path. So we mark it in getTemplateHelper and then
  here call getTemplate.

###
originalDot = Spacebars.dot
Spacebars.dot = (value, args...) ->

  if value instanceof Namespace
    return Blaze._getTemplate(
      "#{value.namespace}.#{args.join('.')}",
      value.templateInstance
    )

  originalDot value, args...



###

  If Namespace gets all the way to the Spacebars.include it means that
  we are in the situation where there is both namespace and component
  with the same name, and user is including a component. But namespace
  reference is created instead (because we do not know in advance that
  there is no Spacebars.dot call around lookup call). So we dereference
  the reference and try to resolve a template. Of course,
  a component might not really exist.

###
originalInclude = Spacebars.include
Spacebars.include = (templateOrFunction, args...) ->


  if templateOrFunction instanceof Namespace
    templateOrFunction = Blaze._getTemplate(
      templateOrFunction.namespace,
      templateOrFunction.templateInstance
    )

  return originalInclude templateOrFunction, args...



###

  We override the original lookup method with a similar one,
  which supports components as well.

  Now the order of the lookup will be, in order:
    a helper of the current template
    a property of the current component
    the name of a component
    the name of a template
    global helper
    a property of the data context

  Returns a function, a non-function value, or null. If a function
  is found, it is bound appropriately.

  NOTE: This function must not establish any reactive dependencies itself.
  If there is any reactivity in the value, lookup should return a function.

  TODO: Should we also lookup for a property of the
  component-level data context (and template-level data context)?

###

Blaze._getTemplateHelper = (template, name, templateInstance) ->

  if template.__helpers.has name

    helper = template.__helpers.get name

    if helper?
      return wrapHelper bindDataContext(helper), templateInstance
    else
      return null


  if name of template

    if template[name]?
      return wrapHelper bindDataContext(template[name]), templateInstance
    else
      return null


  if not templateInstance
    return null

  ###

    Do not resolve component helpers if inside Template.dynamic.
    The reason is that Template.dynamic uses a data context value with
    name "template" internally. But when used inside a component the data
    context lookup is then resolved into a current component's template
    method and not the data context "template". To force the data
    context resolving Template.dynamic should use "this.template" in
    its templates, but it does not, so we have a special case here for it.

  ###
  if template.viewName in [
    "Template.__dynamicWithDataContext", "Template.__dynamic"
  ]
    return null

  ###

    TODO:
    - Blaze.View::lookup should not introduce any reactive dependencies.
    - Can we simply ignore reactivity here?
    - Can this template instance or parent template instances change
      without reconstructing the component as well? I don't think so.
    - Only data context is changing and this is why templateInstance
      or .get() are reactive and we do not care about data context here.

  ###

    A special case to support {{> Foo.Bar}}. This goes through a
    getTemplateHelper path, but we want to redirect it to the
    getTemplate path. So we mark it and leave to Spacebars.dot
    to call getTemplate.

  ###

    This class method more or less just creates an instance of a
    component and calls its renderComponent method. But because we
    want to allow passing arguments to the component in templates,
    we have some complicated code around to extract and pass
    those arguments. It is similar to how data context is passed
    to block helpers. In a data context visible only to the
    block helper template.

    TODO: This could be made less hacky.
    See https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/3913

  ###

    # setup non reactive lookup of data to prevent over rendering and execution
    Tracker.nonreactive =>
      componentClass = @

      try
        ###

          We check data context in a non-reactive way, because we
          want just to peek into it and determine if data context
          contains component arguments or not. And while component
          arguments might change through time, the fact that they are
          there at all or not ("args" template helper was used or not)
          does not change through time. So we can check that non-reactively.

        ###
        data = Template.currentData()

      catch error
        ###

          The exception can be thrown when there is no current view
          which happens when there is no data context yet, thus also
          no arguments were provided through"args" template helper,
          so we just continue normally.

        ###
        data = null

      if data?.constructor isnt argumentsConstructor
        component = new componentClass()
        return component.renderComponent componentParent

      # Arguments were provided through "args" template helper.

      ###

        We want to reactively depend on the data context for
        arguments, so we return a function instead of a template.
        Function will be run inside an autorun, a reactive context.

      ###

      ->
        ###

          We cannot use Template.getData() inside a normal autorun
          because current view is not defined inside a normal autorun.
          But we do not really have to depend reactively on the current
          view, only on the data context of a known
          (the closest Blaze.With) view. So we get this view by ourselves.

        ###
        currentWith = Blaze.getView "with"

        ###

          By default dataVar in the Blaze.With view uses ReactiveVar
          with default equality function which sees all objects
          as different. So invalidations are triggered for every
          data context assignments even if data has not really
          changed. This is why we use our own ReactiveVar with
          EJSON.equals which we keep updated inside an autorun.
          Because it uses EJSON.equals it will invalidate our function
          only if really changes.

          See https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/4073

        ###
        reactiveArguments = new ReactiveVar [], EJSON.equals


        ###

          This autorun is nested in the outside autorun so it gets
          stopped automatically when the outside autorun gets invalidated.

        ###
        Tracker.autorun (computation) ->
          data = currentWith.dataVar.get()

          reactiveArguments.set data._arguments

        ###

          Use arguments for the constructor. Here we register a
          reactive dependency on our own ReactiveVar.

        ###
        component = new componentClass reactiveArguments.get()...

        template = component.renderComponent componentParent

        ###

          It has to be the first callback so that other callbacks
          have a correct data context.

        ###
        registerFirstCreatedHook template, ->

          ###

            Arguments were passed in as a data context. Restore
            original (parent) data context. Same logic as in
            Blaze._InOuterTemplateScope.

          ###
          @.view.originalParentView = @.view.parentView
          @.view.parentView = @.view.parentView.parentView.parentView

        return template

  renderComponent: (componentParent) ->

    ###

      To make sure we do not introduce any reactive dependency.
      This is a conscious design decision. Reactivity should be
      changing data context, but components should be more stable,
      only changing when structure change in rendered DOM. You can change
      the component you are including (or pass different arguments)
      reactively though.

        Create a new component template based on the Blaze template.
        We want our own template  because the same Blaze template
        could be reused between multiple components.

          - Should we cache these templates based on
            (componentName, templateBase) pair?

          - We could use two levels of ES6 Maps,

              states: card.states


            ###

              Here we lookup and see if the card has established a default
              template to render. If it hasn't, we take the first template
              that registered it as a state on the card. This creates
              a state reactive var helper that can be used in templates
              as {{state.get}} and updated by children templates using
              `@.parent()?.state.set("new template")`

            ###

                Here we parse the url on creation of the card.
                1. We split the pathname into segments
                2. We remove and save any querystring at the end of route
                3. We remove any #
                4. If the state.url is already in the pathname we set the
                  route to include all previous segments and the url
                5. If not we push the state.url to the end of the array
                6. We then rebuild the array and define a route for it with
                  the name of our card

              from dynamic templates. It relies on a hardcoded level up
              to find "Template.__dynamicWithDataContext" as a trigger
              to map contentBlock and elseBlock

            Reactive vars are great, but registering them as template helpers
            and setting the default values isn't great yet. Here we attach
            each var to the component that way it can be gotten via .get
            and is available in the template as a tag. I'm a little bit
            worried about polluting the render namespace so should this
            be kept on the vars object?

            To support dynamic url binding through components
            we need to set up an autorun watcher on two variables.

            First, we need to watch for the state (self.component.state)
            to change on the card component. This can be changed from inside
            card states or by accessing the card from the Apollos.states object.

            Second, and more commonly, we need to watch for changes to the
            url of the application. The route can change by a number of
            different manners.

              1. User clicks on an internal link
              2. User clicks on back button of browser
              3. User go directly to route in url bar (this is mainly handled
              by the onCreated card bindings)

            State changes should update the route, and route changes should
            update the state. This get tricky and possibly circular so we
            put some checks in place.

            Not all states of cards have urls so we also have to map previous
            states to fallback if the route changes.

            We do all of this inside a Tracker.nonreactive so that we can
            carefully control the updating and rerunning of changing variables.

          ###

          # if this component being rendered is a card and binds urls
          if component.isCard() and not self.data?.noUrls

            # set up non reactive wrapper
            Tracker.nonreactive ->

              # here get get access to the card
              card = component.getCard(component.componentName())
              card.states or= {}

              ###

                We create storage vars for state, id, and the existing route.
                These will let us prevent a circular updating loop by checking
                for changes. (id should never change)

                * because we are in a tracker nonreactive we can safely get
                the state

              ###
              state = self.component.state.get()
              defaultState = card.default
              id = self.component.id()
              oldRoute = Apollos.Router.current()

              getState = (name) ->

                if not name
                  return false

                strings = name.split("-")
                _id = strings[0]
                _state = strings[1]

                return _state

              getId = (name) ->

                if not name
                  return false

                strings = name.split("-")
                _id = strings[0]

                return _id


              ###

                Here we setup a tracker to watch the status of the state
                of the card level component. The only action that comes out
                of a state change is to update the url to match the url
                provided by the state. This should only happen if the
                url needs to be updated.

                * If the route changes and that changes the state of a card
                then we don't need to update the url so we check that as well

              ###
              Tracker.autorun ->

                # current state of the app
                currentState = self.component.state.get()

                # update local var
                state = currentState

                # get intended url
                stateUrl = Apollos.Router.path("#{id}-#{state}")
                if not stateUrl
                  return

                if window.location.search
                  stateUrl += window.location.search

                # we are at the correct url already
                if oldRoute.path is stateUrl
                  return

                # update the route silently so we don't trigger a route rerun
                Apollos.Router.redirect stateUrl, true
                oldRoute = Apollos.Router.current()
                return



              ###

                Here we setup a tracker to watch the change of the url. The
                goal of this tracker is to lookup the intended state of the
                card and set it. Updating the url should happen within the
                state tracker


              ###
              Tracker.autorun ->

                # register reactive dependency for router
                Apollos.Router.watchPathChange()

                # current route
                currentRoute = Apollos.Router.current()

                ###

                  In order to support the same card being rendered
                  in two instances with different data on the same page,
                  we need to exit this caculation run through if the
                  id of the route doesn't match up with the id of this
                  card.

                  * Route ids can be looked up via the Apollos.Router._routesMap
                  object. Every named route is named with the convention
                  #{id}-#{state}. This is used so we can parse and get the
                  id from the route and the state.

                ###
                routeId = getId(currentRoute.route.name)
                if id isnt routeId and currentRoute.route.name
                  ###

                    If the new route id doesn' match this card. We need to
                    set this card back to its default state

                  ###
                  # self.component.state.set defaultState
                  return



                # map the state from the route to currentState for usage
                currentState = getState currentRoute.route.name

                # if this state has no url, then we don't need to update
                # the url.
