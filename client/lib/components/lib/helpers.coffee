###

  Access parent template instance. "height" is the number of levels beyond
  the current template instance to look. By default block helper template
  instances are skipped, but if "includeBlockHelpers" isset to true,
  they are not.

  See https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/3071

###
parentView = (view, includeBlockHelpers) ->

  if includeBlockHelpers
    return view.originalParentView or view.parentView
  else
    return view.parentView


Blaze.TemplateInstance::__parent = (height, includeBlockHelpers) ->

    # If height is null or undefined, we default to 1, the first parent.
    height or= 1

    i = 0
    template = @

    while (i < height and template)

      view = parentView(template.view, includeBlockHelpers)

      ###

        We skip contentBlock views which are injected by Meteor when using
        block helpers (in addition to block helper view). This matches more
        the visual structure of templates and not the internal implementation.

      ###
      while view and (
        not view.template or
        view.name is "(contentBlock)" or
        view.name is "(elseBlock)"
      )
        view = parentView(view, includeBlockHelpers)

      if not view
        return null

      ###

        Body view has template field, but not templateInstance,
        which more or less signals that we reached the top.

      ###
      if typeof view.templateInstance is "function"
        template = view.templateInstance()
      else
        template = null

      i++

    return template


###

  Allow easy access to a template instance field when you do not know exactly
  on which instance (this, or parent, or parent's parent, ...)
  a field is defined.

  This allows easy restructuring of templates in HTML, moving things to included
  templates without having to change everywhere in the code instance levels.
  It also allows different structures of templates, when once template
  is included at one level, and some other time at another. Levels do
  not matter anymore, just that the field exists somewhere.

###
Blaze.TemplateInstance::get = (fieldName) ->

  template = this

  while template
    if (fieldName of template)
      return template[fieldName]
    template = template.__parent(1, true)
  return
