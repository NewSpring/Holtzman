        Welcome to NewSpring's 2017 Annual Report!
      </h1>
      <p>
        The annual report is an opportunity to reflect on what God has done and to see why the local church is the best investment we can make.
      </p>
      <p>
        At NewSpring, we have so much to celebrate from 2016! Thousands of lives have been changed as a result of your generosity. Throughout this report, you'll meet people who connected to Jesus and the church because of the way you give, serve, and pray.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll also see that 2016 was a year of transition for our church. Growing things change, and NewSpring is no exception. We saw changes in leadership and at our campuses. Lexington merged with Columbia, and two campuses (Powdersville and Clemson) moved into new permanent buildings. We held our largest Gauntlet ever, and we launched Connect - an event designed to help NewSpring attenders connect to Jesus and each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        In every season of our church's history, from 2000 to now, we've seen Jesus come through on His promise to build His church. My hope is that as you read this report, you will see the miracles God is doing every week at NewSpring, and you'll join me in anticipating what God has in store from us next.
      </p>
