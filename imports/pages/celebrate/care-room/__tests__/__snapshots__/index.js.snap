<p>
&quot;I returned to NewSpring for the first time in years in February 2015. I felt like God said &#39;Just get to the care room and talk to someone,&#39; so I did. For the first time in my life I opened up and confessed everything â€” the affair, the suicidal tendencies, and everything else. I told the volunteer I knew the reason I acted the way I did was because I wasn&#39;t saved, and he asked &#39;What are you waiting for?&#39; I accepted Christ into my heart and life. A few months later, my wife and I were remarried.&quot;
