/*


  During the transition from F1 to Rock, we have schedules that need
  to be recovered from our imported data

  The criteria for a `recoverable schedule` is the following:
    IsActive (active: false on GQL query) === false
    GatewayCode (gateway on GQL) === null

  When the schedule is reactivated, the GatewayCode is set and it is set back
  to active.

  If the schedule is canceled permantly, and it doesn't have a GatewayCode,
  it is safe to delete it as no auditable information exists.


  Created schedules can be recovered schedules, or new ones entirely.
  If we are recovering a schedule, an id will be passed along with the call.
  We recover by taking the existing schedule, and performing a PATCH with the
  new details, GatewayCode, and IsActive: true. The workflow in Rock for a
  F1 recovered is based off the trigger from GatewayCode null -> value.

  New schedules are created using a POST and the workflow trigger is based off

  ```
  F1 Schedules:
  - Schedule recovered: GatewayCode != previous GatewayCode (alert finance to cancel in F1)
  - Schedule (from F1) canceled: DELETE (alert finance to cancel in F1)

  Rock/Apollos Schedules:
  - Schedule created: generic new record (:partyparrot:)
  - Schedule canceled: IsActive === false (:frowning:)
  ```
