Core Blocks
=======================

Blocks denote components that are tied into exterior data / states. They represent more complex actions and are less flexible in nature than straight components. Ideally blocks have a 1:1 ratio with a key in the redux store and don't use any platform (e.g. Meteor, Rock, Craft) specific tie-ins. When this is not possible try to document and plan for refactoring later.
