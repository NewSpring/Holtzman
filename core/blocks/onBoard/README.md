On Board Block
=======================

The on boarding block is used to handle the workflow of data for on-boarding a user. This includes [signing in](#sign-in), [signing up](#sign-up), [sending a password reset](#forgot-password), and [resetting a password](#reset-password). This block is used in conjunction with the [on board actions](../../actions/on-board/README.md) and the [on board reducer](../../reducers/on-board/README.md).

## Entry point

When using the on board component, it is best to include the entire block. [The index file](./index.jsx) contains the state handling of the sub components as well as integration with redux. Usage:

```javascript
import { Component, PropTypes} from "react"
import OnBoard from "apollos/core/blocks/onBoard"


export default class AccountPage extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <OnBoard/>
    )
  }
}

```

#### Props

The block does not take or support any props currently

## Sign-in

The [sign-in component](./on-board.Signin.jsx) is used to handle both sign-in and sign-up states. It renders the toggle switch between sign-in and sign-up, the form for taking data, and handles validation using [inputs](../../components/forms/README.md#inputs).
