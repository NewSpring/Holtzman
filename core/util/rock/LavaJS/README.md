LavaJS
=======================

@TODO abstract

Implementing Lava template language in Javascript for ease of use with RockRMS and other CMS systems.

> In order to have an easy to use admin interface, we could / should adopt Lava from Rock as the universal CMS templating interpolation syntax. Then any data retrevial system (be it a GraphQL server, an application server, or even a client app) can take data and render tempaltes universally across mulitple systems. To keep the inital version simple, we should build it hardcoded to our Rock Graph mapping. Ideally, if the native API supports everything, it would be sick to allow multiple mapping sources, (GQL, API, native DB).

> Coming Soon
